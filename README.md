# TLP Bot

This is a README for a discord bot created for [The Lyre Project](https://thelyreproject.ca/) to automate and simplify workflows such as event request approvals, event reminders, etc.

The bot uses [Google App Script](https://developers.google.com/apps-script) as its backend to retrieve data such as Calendar events, filled in Google Forms, etc.

## Features
* Weekly and monthly reminders from Google Calendar
* Get details about a specific calendar event sent to Discord
* Send notifications when a new Google request form has been submitted
* Approve a pending event which will:
  * Move the pending event doc into the approved folder
  * Create a calendar event for the respective event
  * Notify on Discord about the approved event

##  Prerequisites

- **Node.js** v18 or higher (Discord.js v14+ requires this)
- **npm** (comes bundled with Node.js)
